Its elegant and refined behavior clashes with that of the barbaric Perrserker. The relationship between the two is one of mutual disdain.

This Pokémon’s habitat shapes its physique. According to some theories, life in warm ocean waters causes this variation to develop.
Subjecting this Pokémon to a strong force causes it to secrete a strange purple fluid. Though harmless, the fluid is awfully sticky.

Its search for food sometimes leads it onto land, where it leaves behind a sticky trail of slime as it passes through.
The softness of its body helps disperse the force of impacts, so although its body is uncommonly squishy, it’s also surprisingly resilient.

Perhaps seeking company, it approaches children. However, it often quickly runs away again when the children play too roughly with it.
The gathering of many souls gave rise to this Pokémon. During humid seasons, they seem to appear in abundance.

It grabs people and Pokémon and carries them off somewhere. Where do they go? Nobody knows.

From its rear, it sprays a foul-smelling liquid at opponents. It aims for their faces, and it can hit them from over 16 feet away.
If it lifts its tail and points its rear at you, beware. It’s about to spray you with a fluid stinky enough to make you faint.

In its belly, it reserves stinky fluid that it shoots from its tail during battle. As this Pokémon’s diet varies, so does the stench of its fluid.
It digs holes in the ground to make its nest. The stench of the fluid it lets fly from the tip of its tail is extremely potent.

It appears in ancient ruins. The pattern on its body doesn’t come from any culture in the Galar region, so it remains shrouded in mystery.
Polishing Bronzor to a shine makes its surface reflect the truth, according to common lore. Be that as it may, Bronzor hates being polished.

Its poison is potent, but it rarely sees use. This Pokémon prefers to use physical force instead, going on rampages with its car-crushing strength.
It’s so vicious that it’s called the Sand Demon. Yet when confronted by Hippowdon, Drapion keeps a low profile and will never pick a fight.

It steals things from people just to amuse itself with their frustration. A rivalry exists between this Pokémon and Nickit.
Opponents that get drawn in by its adorable behavior come away with stinging scratches from its claws and stinging pride from its laughter.

Late at night, it appears beside people’s pillows. As it feeds on dreams, the patterns on its body give off a faint glow.
It eats dreams and releases mist. The mist is pink when it’s eating a good dream, and black when it’s eating a nightmare.

When dark mists emanate from its body, don’t get too near. If you do, your nightmares will become reality.
It drowses and dreams all the time. It’s best to leave it be if it’s just woken up, as it’s a terrible grump when freshly roused from sleep.

Where people go, these Pokémon follow. If you’re scattering food for them, be careful— several hundred of them can gather at once.
It’s forgetful and not very bright, but many Trainers love it anyway for its friendliness and sincerity.

Evolves into Boldore-0 @ 25 (LevelUp) [0]

It’s as hard as steel, but apparently a long soak in water will cause it to soften a bit.
When it detects a noise, it starts to move. The energy core inside it makes this Pokémon slightly warm to the touch.

Evolves into Gigalith-0 @ 0 (Trade) [0]

If you see its orange crystals start to glow, be wary. It’s about to fire off bursts of energy.
It relies on sound in order to monitor what’s in its vicinity. When angered, it will attack without ever changing the direction it’s facing.

Evolves into Swoobat-0 @ 0 (LevelUpFriendship) [0]

While inside a cave, if you look up and see lots of heart-shaped marks lining the walls, it’s evidence that Woobat live there.
It emits ultrasonic waves as it flutters about, searching for its prey—bug Pokémon.

The auspicious shape of this Pokémon’s nose apparently led some regions to consider Swoobat a symbol of good luck.

It brings its claws together and whirls around at high speed before rushing toward its prey.
It’s a digger, using its claws to burrow through the ground. It causes damage to vegetable crops, so many farmers have little love for it.

Timburr that have started carrying logs that are about three times their size are nearly ready to evolve.

It shows off its muscles to Machoke and other Gurdurr. If it fails to measure up to the other Pokémon, it lies low for a little while.
Gurdurr excels at demolition—construction is not its forte. In any case, there’s skill in the way this Pokémon wields its metal beam.

Concrete mixed by Conkeldurr is much more durable than normal concrete, even when the compositions of the two materials are the same.
When going all out, this Pokémon throws aside its concrete pillars and leaps at opponents to pummel them with its fists.

Graceful ripples running across the water’s surface are a sure sign that Tympole are singing in high-pitched voices below.
It uses sound waves to communicate with others of its kind. People and other Pokémon species can’t hear its cries of warning.

It weakens its prey with sound waves intense enough to cause headaches, then entangles them with its sticky tongue.
On occasion, their cries are sublimely pleasing to the ear. Palpitoad with larger lumps on their bodies can sing with a wider range of sounds.

It shoots cotton from its body to protect itself. If it gets caught up in hurricane-strength winds, it can get sent to the other side of the Earth.
Weaving together the cotton of both Cottonee and Eldegoss produces exquisite cloth that’s highly prized by many luxury brands.

It scatters cotton all over the place as a prank. If it gets wet, it’ll become too heavy to move and have no choice but to answer for its mischief.
As long as this Pokémon bathes in sunlight, its cotton keeps growing. If too much cotton fluff builds up, Whimsicott tears it off and scatters it.

In the past, it often appeared on the dinner table. The meat of red-striped Basculin is on the fatty side, and it’s more popular with the youth.

The way it brushes away grime with its tail can be helpful when cleaning. But its focus on spotlessness can make cleaning more of a hassle.
They pet each other with their tails as a form of greeting. Of the two, the one whose tail is fluffier is a bit more boastful.

Its body secretes oil that this Pokémon spreads over its nest as a coating to protect it from dust. Cinccino won’t tolerate even a speck of the stuff.
A special oil that seeps through their fur helps them avoid attacks. The oil fetches a high price at market.
